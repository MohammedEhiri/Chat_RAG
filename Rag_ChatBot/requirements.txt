# --- Core Frameworks ---
streamlit
ollama>=0.1.7           # For interacting with local LLMs via Ollama

# --- Document Loading and Processing ---
# unstructured uses different parsers based on file type.
# [pdf] ensures pypdf (or similar) is installed for PDF parsing.
unstructured[pdf]
python-docx             # For .docx file parsing by unstructured
lxml                    # Often used by unstructured for HTML/XML elements within files
nltk                    # Used for sentence tokenization, potentially by unstructured or text splitters

# --- Embeddings ---
sentence-transformers   # For generating text embeddings locally

# --- Vector Store ---
chromadb>=0.4.24        # Local vector database

# --- Image Handling (often needed implicitly by document libraries) ---
Pillow

# --- Potentially Needed Extras (Uncomment if features added or errors occur) ---
# python-pptx           # For .pptx parsing by unstructured
# beautifulsoup4        # For HTML parsing by unstructured
# pytesseract           # For OCR within images (Requires Tesseract system installation)
# unstructured[local-inference] # Installs *many* dependencies for local model-based processing (like Detectron2, Tesseract). Use if you need advanced layout detection/OCR and have resources. Can replace some explicit deps above but might be heavy.
